## Step 1: Shopping cart

* You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.
* Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
* Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost
* For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] =&gt; £2.05
* Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates take a list of strings as input

## Step 2: Simple offers
* The shop decides to introduce two new offers
  * buy one, get one free on Apples
  * 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
* Update your checkout functions accordingly

## Step 3: More complicated offers
* The shop adds Bananas which cost 20p
* Bananas are added to the same buy one, get one free offer as apples
* The cheapest item should be given free first
* Update your checkout


## Step 4: Even more complicated offers
● The shop adds melons which cost £1
● Melons are available through a separate 3 for 2 offer
● Update your checkout
